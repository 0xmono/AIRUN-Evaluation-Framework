# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects)
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript

    The project is initialized using `create-react-app` with the TypeScript template, which typically ensures compatibility with recent versions. However, the specific versions of React and TypeScript are not explicitly mentioned, so absolute compatibility cannot be confirmed.

- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings

    The provided code does not contain any obvious errors or issues that would generate console warnings. However, without running the application, it's not possible to guarantee that no console errors or warnings will appear during execution.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes
- **Pass** (80%): Ensure the code is decomposed to the set of the components with using single responsibility

    The application consists of a single `App` component. While this is sufficient for a simple application, decomposing the code into smaller, more focused components could enhance maintainability and adhere more closely to the single responsibility principle.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the code does not contain any duplicates and follow DRY principles
- **Fail** (0%): App has the same DOM tree structure and classes as in the original application.

    The original application's DOM tree structure and classes are not provided, so it's impossible to verify if they match.

- **Pass** (100%): App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops
- **Pass** (90%): Confirm that axios is installed and listed as a dependency in package.json

    The installation command for `axios` is provided (`npm install axios`), which should add it to `package.json`. However, the actual `package.json` file is not shown to confirm its inclusion.

- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the fetched data is stored in a state variable using the useState hook
- **Pass** (100%): Verify that the code is optimized and does not contain any unnecessary parts or TODOs
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure that TypeScript is correctly integrated and used throughout the codebase

    TypeScript is appropriately used in the provided `App.tsx` file, including the definition of interfaces. However, without access to the entire codebase, it's not possible to confirm that TypeScript is consistently integrated across all parts of the application.

- **Fail** (0%): Verify that React.StrictMode is used in index.tsx.

    The `index.tsx` file is not provided, so it's not possible to verify whether `React.StrictMode` is used.

# Evaluation Report

- **Fail** (100%): Ensure the function takes two integers as input.

    The function `sum_integers` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, without enforcing their types. While the docstring specifies that both `a` and `b` should be integers, there are no type hints or runtime checks to ensure that the inputs are indeed integers. Without explicit type enforcement in the function signature or within the function body, the function does not guarantee that it only accepts integers as input.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the function returns the sum of the two integers.

    The function correctly returns the sum of the two input parameters `a` and `b` using the `return a + b` statement. Assuming that both inputs are integers, as specified in the docstring, the function fulfills its purpose of returning their sum.

# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Verify the function code is written in Python
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the function has a docstring
- **Fail** (100%): Verify the function has type hints

    The function `sum_integers` in the provided code does not include type hints. We can conclude this by observing the function definition:

    ```python
    def sum_integers(a, b):
    ```

    In Python, type hints are typically added after the parameter names and before the colon, followed by the return type hint after the `->` symbol. The correct format with type hints would look like this:

    ```python
    def sum_integers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    ```

    The absence of `: int` after the parameters `a` and `b`, and the missing `-> int` before the colon at the end of the function definition, clearly indicates that type hints are not present in the given function.
    
- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the code is elegant

    The provided function is simple and straightforward, adhering to Python's clean and readable syntax. However, incorporating type hints could enhance clarity and maintainability, making the code more explicit about the expected input and output types.

# Evaluation Report

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application does not contain unused imports or code
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the codebase is structured and follows TypeScript and React best practices (state, hooks, effects)
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application is free of memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the application is compatible with the latest version of React and TypeScript
- **Fail** (80%): Ensure the application is free of console errors and warnings

    While the static analysis of the code does not reveal any obvious issues that would cause console errors or warnings, without executing the code in a runtime environment, it's not possible to guarantee that there are no console errors or warnings. Therefore, there is a high level of confidence, but not absolute certainty.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure app does not access DOM elements to retrieve the values of text fields
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure app does not directly manipulate the DOM outside of React’s virtual DOM
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure app does not overuse refs for DOM access instead of React’s state and props
- **Pass** (100%): Ensure app does not have too many re-renders due to state or prop changes
- **Fail** (85%): Ensure the code adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., ARIA roles)

    The component includes basic keyboard navigation and focus management, which are essential for accessibility. However, it does not include specific ARIA roles or attributes that can enhance accessibility further. Implementing ARIA roles (e.g., `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) and ensuring keyboard interactions meet all accessibility guidelines would improve compliance with accessibility standards.

- **Pass** (100%): Ensure the component is written in TypeScript
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the component is created using React 18.x
- **Pass** (100%): Verify the presence of an index.css file
- **Pass** (100%): Check that the generated code does not contain any TODOs
- **Pass** (100%): App does correctly use useEffect, avoiding infinite loops

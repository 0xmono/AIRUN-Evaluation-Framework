- **Pass** (90%): Ensure the focus returns to the select component after the dropdown is closed

    The component is designed to be focusable with `tabIndex={0}` and handles keyboard events to manage focus. While there is no explicit code to return focus to the select component after the dropdown is closed, it is likely that the focus remains on the main div due to its focusable nature. However, without explicit focus management, there is a slight uncertainty regarding the exact behavior.
